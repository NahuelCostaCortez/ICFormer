# ICFormer

ICFormer is a novel Deep Learning model based on a Transformer encoder that leverages self-attention on the evolution of incremental capacity (IC) curves to accurately identify relevant changes in LIB degradation trajectories. It does not only detects knees, but also anticipates them while also outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in diagnosing degradation modes, making it a powerful tool for predicting battery health. ICFormer can provide valuable knowledge on the factors contributing to capacity loss and offer advanced insights for battery management and predictive maintenance strategies.
